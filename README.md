# Ai-assistant 

## Context 
Welcome to the Ai assistant! This project was made during my internship as a Software developer in a small SaaS company called Cape. The companies main focus is on creating a marketing platform which helps clients start launch and monitor their marketing campaigns.

## My Task 

My task was improving the user-experience in this huge platform and more specifically improve the productivity of its users, this is where my project comes in hand. The Ai-assistant's purpose is to help the users to improve their work flow by providing the array of features that are text related. 

## How it works
I used chat-GPT-4 turbo API which was a grate fit to the use case of the tool. In order to make the LLM model to perform these tasks i had to come up with predefined prompts that would explain the subject of the task in a detailed and sophisticated manner in order to be sure that the model is going to understand what it has to be done. 

## Tools for building the project

* **React.js:** The compnay was using React for the coding the interface of the tool.

* **TypeScript.js:** Was used for handling the API as well as the custome prompts

* **ScSS:** Was used for styling the tool in Cape's usual brand identity

* **Material UI:**  This compoanent library was used aslo for styling

Unfortunately I can't show any code because of company policies, however i can show demo videos of how the tool works.
